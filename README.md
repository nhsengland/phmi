An initial commit of the PHMI IG dashboard. It uses python 3.7.

Currently this just has an nhs england skin as used by the [NCDR](https://data.england.nhs.uk/ncdr/database)

It uses sass but with no clever build tool ie
`sass --watch phmi/static/css/styles.scss:phmi/static/css/styles.css`

There's a good chance everything needs to be renamed but hopefully its a good understandable base to start from.
